# AlgoGraph

- Description : AlgoGraph is a web application developed using React and JavaScript that offers an immersive and interactive experience for visualizing and comprehending various pathfinding algorithms. This project aims to facilitate a deeper understanding of algorithmic concepts by providing a real-time representation of how these algorithms operate on a grid-based environment.

- The application allows users to select and observe the execution of popular pathfinding algorithms such as Dijkstra's, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each algorithm's progress is displayed on a grid, providing a visual representation of the steps taken to find the optimal path from a starting point to an end point.

## Features:

- Algorithm Visualization: Gain insights into how pathfinding algorithms operate by visualizing their step-by-step execution. Each algorithm's progress is displayed on a grid, making it easy to comprehend their decision-making processes.

- Speed Control: Adjust the visualization speed to match your learning pace. Whether you prefer rapid demonstrations or a slower, more detailed exploration, the app caters to your preferences with fast, medium, and slow speed options.

- Weighted Grids: Dive deeper into algorithmic complexity by introducing weighted grids. With this feature, you can assign varying weights to specific cells, allowing you to observe how the algorithms adapt to obstacles and make optimal decisions based on the assigned weights.

- Clearing and Resetting: Experimentation is encouraged in this visualizer. Clear walls and reset visited cells with a single click, allowing you to iterate and compare different scenarios effortlessly.

- Dynamic Start and End Points: Break free from static start and end points. The app enables you to dynamically move these points, providing a dynamic perspective on how the algorithms adapt to changes in real-time.
